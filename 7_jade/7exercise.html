The purpose of this exercise is to learn about auctions. The exercise is to develop a distributed application in Jade that makes use of an <i>English Auction</i> protocol to distribute some good.

<h2>Auction</h2>

Study the rules of an English Auction [1,2]. Each client has a a bidding strategy, that depends on its total budget, the remaining budget and the product for sale. The auctioneer has a bottom price. If the good cannot be sold for that price, it remains in store.

<h2>Application</h2> 

Auctions are useful to distribute goods that are scarce and have a different value for different agents. One example is antiques. In this exercise you will apply the auction to an antique sale. At the web site of the well-known Amsterdam auction house <a href="http://www.deeland.nl/">De Eland</a> you will find many regulations, for example about payment and delivery. Lets assume that "De Eland" wants to start an separate internet antiques sale.  You must develop a prototype of an auctioning system, to test whether this is feasible. 


<h2>Exercise</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Design, implement and test an auctioneer agent and several buyer agents in Jade, which can carry out an English auction [2]. 

<li>
Modify your design and program to implement a Dutch Auction and a second-price sealed bid auction in Jade [2]. Make minimal changes in your original design and program. 
</ol>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
<li> The implementations of the English, Dutch and second-price sealed bid auction. Be sure to also add comments in your code, and make sure that your code compiles and runs without errors!
</li>
<li>
A short document describing how your program works, what design choices you made and how the code can be run. Be sure to also include your student number in this document.
</li>
