\subsection{Avoid obstacles}
  When agents walk in the block world, they may encounter some obstacles,
  including stones and other agents. When the next block where the agents
  attend to access has already occupied by such obstacles, then the
  execution of such plan will fail. So, we use PRRULE to fix such failed
  plan to help the agents get the ability to avoid obstacles.
  The detailed method is illustrated in Figure 1.

\subsection{Avoid blind commitment}
If the destination where the agents want to go is occupied by a stone or
surrounded by stones, then the agents can't achieve his commitment.
If the agent is blind commitment agent, then he will consist try to achieve
such commitment and ignore other tasks. Now, in our current version,
we just simply record how many times the agents have tried to achieve his
commitment, if the counter is larger than a specific number, then,
the agents should think that the goal is impossible to achieve and they
will drop such goal.

Of course, there are some smarter ways to avoid blind commitment.
For instance, directly detect the location of destination whether
has been occupied or surrounded by stones. If yes, directly drop
such goal.
\subsection{Supply information to the nearest agent}
Clean bombs agents: barry1 and barry2.

Find bombs agent: hally.

Process for barry1 and barry2: send messages to inform hally whether they
are idle or busy, the messages only be sent when the status was changed for
barry1 or barry2. For instance, turn into busy from idle or turn into idle
from busy.

Process for hally: receive the messages from barry1 and barry2.
If she finds that if and only if one clean bombs agent is idle,
then send the new bomb location to the idle agent.
If both clean bomb agents are idle or busy, then detection the distances
between agents and the bomb, and send the bomb location message to the agent
nearest to the bomb.

\subsection{Drop bombs to the nearest trap}
Every time, after the agents pick up a bomb,
they will re-sense all the traps in the block world,
and calculate the distance between his current location and each trap
location, and then find out the nearest trap.

We developed a pcrule named det\_nearest\_trap to help the agents detect the
nearest trap.

\subsection{Check trap and bombs at every step}
In my opinion, I think it is more reasonable for barry1 and barry2 to detect
the nearest trap once each time when they pick up a bomb. Because in other
time, they don't need to update the trap information.

For helping hally to detect bomb at every step, we just simply move the
plan of detection the bombs into the pcrule goto(X,Y,M) and name it as
hally\_goto(X,Y,M).
