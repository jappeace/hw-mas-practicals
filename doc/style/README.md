#Style guide

To not make ~~our~~ my eyes bleed.

## Coding style

see `Mother.java` for the overview

### Name length

shit in higher scopes should have better names compared to stuff in lower scope
ie if you name a class you should take some time to figure out a good name 
for it. This is fucking important ass it will blot all over your code.
Naming a method/attribute is a little less important and naming a local var
is even less.
